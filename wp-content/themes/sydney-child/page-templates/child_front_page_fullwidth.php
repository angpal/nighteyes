				<p> Night Eyes are an essential item for all camping and outdoor enthusiasts. Designed as a safety device to prevent accidents and injury caused by tripping on tent ropes or walking 
					into objects at night. <br><br>


					The tags will glow for up to 10 hours* enabling easy detection of potential hazards throughout the night. This is an accessory no camping or outdoor enthusiast should be 
					without. If you are fed-up with constantly tripping over tent ropes, stubbing your toes on tent pegs or not being able to find the tent zippers in the middle of the night, Night Eyes 
					glow in the dark tags will make your next outdoor adventure safer and more enjoyable. Protect your family and equipment by using these easy to attach glow in the dark tags.<br><br>


					Night Eyes fluorescent green colour makes them highly visible during the day and at night produces a bright iridescent glow meaning you don’t have to be able to see the tent ropes only the Night Eyes tags.<br><br>


					If you are mature adventurers or have young children running around your camp site, Night Eyes are an essential safety device to prevent unnecessary tripping and nasty falls.<br><br>


					This is one item you can’t afford not to pack in your camping kit. They’re also great gifts for your outdoor adventuring friends and family. Keep a pack handy in your glove box or 4X4 recovery kit.
